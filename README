NAME
    HTML::HTML5::Writer - output a DOM as HTML5

VERISON
    0.03

SYNOPSIS
     use HTML::HTML5::Writer;
 
     my $writer = HTML::HTML5::Writer->new;
     print $writer->document($dom);

DESCRIPTION
    This module outputs XML::LibXML::Node objects as HTML5 strings. It works
    well on DOM trees that represent valid HTML/XHTML documents; less well
    on other DOM trees.

  Constructor
    "$writer = HTML::HTML5::Writer->new(%opts)"
        Create a new writer object. Options include:

        *   markup

            Choose which serialisation of HTML5 to use: 'html' or 'xhtml'.

        *   polyglot

            Set to '1' in order to attempt to produce output which works as
            both XML and HTML.

        *   doctype

            Set this to a string to choose which <!DOCTYPE> tag to output.
            Note, this purely sets the <!DOCTYPE> tag and does not change
            how the rest of the document is output.

            The following constants are provided for convenience:
            DOCTYPE_HTML5, DOCTYPE_LEGACY, DOCTYPE_NIL, DOCTYPE_HTML32,
            DOCTYPE_HTML4, DOCTYPE_XHTML1, DOCTYPE_XHTML11,
            DOCTYPE_XHTML_BASIC, DOCTYPE_XHTML_RDFA.

            Defaults to DOCTYPE_HTML5.

        *   encoding

            This module always returns strings in Perl's internal utf8
            encoding, but you can set the 'encoding' option to 'ascii' to
            create output that would be suitable for re-encoding to ASCII
            (e.g. it will entity-encode characters which do not exist in
            ASCII).

        *   quote_attributes

            Set this to a 'force' to force attributes to be quoted.
            Otherwise, the writer will automatically detect when attributes
            need quoting.

        *   voids

            Set to 'slash' to force void elements to always be terminated
            with '/>'. Otherwise, they'll only be terminated that way in
            polyglot or XHTML documents.

        *   start_tags and end_tags

            Except in polyglot and XHTML documents, some elements allow
            their start and/or end tags to be omitted in certain
            circumstances. By setting these to 'force', you can prevent them
            from being omitted.

        *   refs

            Special characters that can't be encoded as named entities need
            to be encoded as numeric character references instead. These can
            be expressed in decimal or hexadecimal. Setting this option to
            'dec' or 'hex' allows you to choose. The default is 'hex'.

  Public Methods
    "$writer->is_xhtml"
        Boolean indicating if $writer is configured to output XHTML.

    "$writer->is_polyglot"
        Boolean indicating if $writer is configured to output polyglot HTML.

    "$writer->document($node)"
        Outputs (i.e. returns a string that is) an XML::LibXML::Document as
        HTML.

    "$writer->element($node)"
        Outputs an XML::LibXML::Element as HTML.

    "$writer->attribute($node)"
        Outputs an XML::LibXML::Attr as HTML.

    "$writer->text($node)"
        Outputs an XML::LibXML::Text as HTML.

    "$writer->cdata($node)"
        Outputs an XML::LibXML::CDATASection as HTML.

    "$writer->comment($node)"
        Outputs an XML::LibXML::Comment as HTML.

    "$writer->doctype"
        Outputs the writer's DOCTYPE.

    "$writer->encode_entities($string, characters=>$more)"
        Takes a string and returns the same string with some special
        characters replaced. These special characters do not include any of
        '&', '<', '>' or '"', but you can provide a string of additional
        characters to treat as special:

         $encoded = $writer->encode_entities($raw, characters=>'&<>"');

    "$writer->encode_entity($char)"
        Returns $char entity-encoded. Encoding is done regardless of whether
        $char is "special" or not.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    Certain DOM constructs cannot be output in non-XML HTML. e.g.

     my $xhtml = <<XHTML;
     <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <head><title>Test</title></head>
      <body><hr>This text is within the HR element</hr></body>
     </html>
     XHTML
     my $dom    = XML::LibXML->new->parse_string($xhtml);
     my $writer = HTML::HTML5::Writer->new(markup=>'html');
     print $writer->document($dom);

    In HTML, there's no way to serialise that properly in HTML. Right now
    this module just outputs that HR element with text contained within it,
    a la XHTML. In future versions, it may emit a warning or throw an error.

    In these cases, the HTML::HTML5::{Parser,Writer} combination is not
    round-trippable.

    Outputting elements and attributes in foreign (non-XHTML) namespaces is
    implemented pretty naively and not thoroughly tested. I'd be interested
    in any feedback people have, especially on round-trippability of SVG,
    MathML and RDFa content in HTML.

    Please report any bugs to <http://rt.cpan.org/>.
